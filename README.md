# Imaging2D_WLSQ
Imaging with 2D wavefields using Weighted Least SQuares (WLSQ) extrapolation.

The code was develop in Python programming language and all computationaly expensive parts are
implemented in C++ and C++-CUDA for better optimization. The code is still under development for
optimization purpose however it is alreafy functional and correct.

To run the code you need to compile the source code present in directory cpp source using the Makefile
in the same directory. To be able to compile the code you need to have installed Intel MKL and CUDA.
Both are available for free download.
